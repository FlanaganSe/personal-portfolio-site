# Solo Traveling Asia Retrospective and Tips

![Kyoto](/blog-images/kyoto.jpeg)

I recently got back from the capstone of my sabbatical, a solo trip to East Asia. In September, for my very first long term solo trip, I booked a one way ticket to Hong Kong with one small backpack and no itinerary.

For years I've flirted with the dream of becoming a 'digital nomad'. Well, not forever, but it sounds compelling to experience for a few years. I've long been a fan of [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio?ref=levels.io) and have been a regular peruser of https://nomadlist.com. Very quickly after deciding to take a sabbatical I realized this would be the perfect time. I was in an incredibly privedged situation by having the means to travel, the COVID vaccine allowing international travel again, and months of freedom.

What followed may have been the most unique, inspiring trip in my life as I went from Hong Kong to Taipei and then throughout Japan.

It's cheesy but my consistent takeaway was that travel, and life, is as beautiful as you allow it to be. Solo traveling, notably in a country with differing cultures, re-frames yourself to be exceptionally aware of the present. In a way it almost feels like meditation and you begin to feel your emotions more. There are endless moments of inquisitiveness, admiration, and appreciation -- but also moments of fatigue and loneliness. At times it can feel like one long rollercoaster as you navigate the swings while embracing the excitement.

Travel teaches you more about yourself. When you have complete freedom, the decisions you make are more representative of who you are.

Some tips I have for other solo travelers include:

### CouchSurfing

[Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) is an app created primarily for travelers to 'couchsurf' and stay with hosts. Prior to arrival you can search your next destination for a list of hosts and connect with them. Popular cities will have dozens of available hosts, most of which are super travelers themselves.

But the most valuable feature of the app is that it also has hangouts and events. In popular cities you can find dozens of travelers, or sometimes hosts, that list themselves as looking for XYZ thing to do. Often this will be going on hikes, getting a drink, getting dinner, or just walking around. I found the ease of meeting other travelers even easier on the app than by staying at hostels. Popular cities will also have daily events whether it be a travelers' meetup, bar carwl, language exchanges, site-seeing, or more.

Initial interactions were always a bit awkward (and topics divert to travel) but everyone I met was friendly, open, and uniquely interesting. Most people were devoted travelers with endlessly outrageous stories of previous trips.

There are two cons with the app. First, it's only valuable in tier-A cities or in areas where there are a signficiant number of travelers. Second, it's unfortunately a paid app now (only $3 a month) which is fine but certainly limits the number of travelers using it.

### Finding things to do:

ChatGPT may have been the absolute best resource for finding things to do. It's extremely easy to send a quick message of "Hey, I'm solo traveling in Kyoto and am staying by the Kyoto Imperial Palace. What are some must see sites in the area before I leave?". You'll be barraged with an array of suggestions and the endless ability to request more. The only flaw with ChatGPT was with restaurant suggestions -- they were often too far and more than once suggested resutarants that did not exist.

### Miscellaneous:

- On arrival to Japan you **must** have a return trip booked. I believe for fear that you may overstay your guest visa. I never had issues in previous countries but on arrival in Japan I was forced to book a return flight somewhere outside of Japan before I could go through customs.
- Download the Google Translate app but don't expect much from it. The seemingly most valuable feature is being able to point the camera to translate text but I found it wishy-washy in most situations when I needed it. It also feels clunky to pull out your phone. It can be valuable but the technology isn't far enough to overly make the language barriers any easier.
- Hostels are surprisingly... Not cheap. I would be perfectly okay staying in hostels but often they were the same price as mid-tier hotels.
