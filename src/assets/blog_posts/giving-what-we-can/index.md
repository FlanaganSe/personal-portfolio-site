Giving What We Can, Signee #7552.

Today, May 22nd, 2022, I have signed the pledge to donate at least 10% of my income, for the rest of my life, to organizations that can use it most effectively to improve the lives of others. 


I had dabbled with the decision for some time but was pushed over the edge after reading [How Bad Are Things](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/24/how-bad-are-things/) by Scott Alexander, where he described his experience as a psychiatrist in my current town of Ann Arbor Michigan.

It's great to dream and discuss, on a grand scale, how the world could be better, but I believe it's equally important to take actionable steps as individuals to try to alleviate baldness rather than risk adding fuel to the flame.

I would encourage anyone reading this to consider reading about [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) and reflect on their own ability to make the world a better place -- whether focused personally, locally, nationally, or globally.
