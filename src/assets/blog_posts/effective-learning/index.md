Information on effective learning strategies. This information comes almost entirely from the book [Make It Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Peter-C-Brown-ebook/dp/B00JQ3FN7M/) by Peter Brown and [Improving Students' Learning with Effective Learning Techniques](https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf), a meta-study by the Association for Psychological Science.

### Highly Effective Strategies

#### Spaced Repetition

- Combats "The forgetting curve" by repeatedly returning to topics in spaced intervals
- How to apply: Take notes and learn a new topic. Then return to the notes in an increasing interval for as long as the information is relatively retained (e.g. 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days)

#### Testing

- Frequent no-stakes testing significantly improves learning and information retention
- How to apply: Take a practice test on learned material. Free recall and short answer tests may be best but cued recall (flash cards, multiple choice, fill in the blank) are also good

Elaborative interrogation: Self-questioning (asking why?) or self-explanation (explaining details to yourself) is a simple form of self-testing and can improve recall. Learning by “doing” is also a form of testing by forcing you to recall and use your knowledge.

### Moderately Effective Strategies:

#### Interleaving

- Mix together different (but similar) topics. Return to old ones and reflext on how the information relates
- How to apply: After learning a new topic, go back and briefly review multiple past lessons — test yourself on them.

#### Summarizing

- Summarizing, especially by self-explanation / active recall can improve learning.
- How to apply: After finishing a section, attempt to write a summary and go back and fill in gaps. The cornell note-taking method incorporates this strategy.

### Questionable Strategies

#### Re-reading

- Re-reading can help get a better overall picture but is a poor strategy for retaining finer details
- Avoid mass re-reading in on session and instead pair it with another strategy (e.g. spacing, testing)

#### Imagery

- Only beneficial for retaining information on easy-to-visualize topics

## Bad Learning Strategies

#### Cramming

- Does it need an explanation?

#### Highlighting Text

- Provides little-to-no benfit over reading the text without highlighting

#### Multi-tasking

- The human brain has a switching-cost when changing its focus to a new task

### Improving Productivity

Improving productivity is largely about eliminating bottlenecks, such as multi-tasking, distractions, or psychological factors

- Find ways to create deadlines; both short deadlines (hours / days) and long-term (weeks, months, or years)

Lower your cognitive load by splitting up time into:

- Planning: Time for planning any micro-tasks to be completed
- Decision making: Time for making decisions, especially if requiring research, discussion or planning
- Work: Time for complting the micro tasks / overall project
