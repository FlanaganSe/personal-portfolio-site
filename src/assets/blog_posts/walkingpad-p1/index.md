# WalkingPad P1 Thoughts and Repair

In early 2023 I purchased a KingSmith WalkingPad P1. I became interested after a co-worker of mine had purchased an exercise bike that he could use while working at his desk. I thought the idea silly at first, but that's because I've never been a fan of exercise bikes. The seat always becomes painful and the amount of calories you could feasible burn while working seemed negligible.

But the idea stayed in the back of my mind for a few days and then I dove into researching. If you check amazon for 'desk treadmill' you'll find hundreds of options that are all surprisingly cheap. One thing you may also notice is that none come from name brands. Almost every product in this category are cheap treadmill that are likely to be purchased from overseas wholesalers and sold by dropshippers.

A treadmill isn't necessarily something I'd rather get the offbrand of so I decided to check namebrands but there aren't many players in this space. The LifeSpan TR1000 or TR1200 seem to be the most long-time brand in this space but the treadmills go for $1000-$2000 each. Going above that price range and you'll find a few more brands including <Retrieve list of brands later>. I wasn't even sure if I'd use a walking treadmill so I went back to looking at the cheap stuff. The WalkingPad brand stood out to me because the treadmill folds to be extremely compact, but also because KingSmith is a subsidiary of Xiaomi.

I don't own many Xiaomi product sbut at least it's a brand I recognize and one I have trust in. I went with the WalkingPad P1 for a cool $375 after catching it on "sale" (sales are eternal from what I've seen).
