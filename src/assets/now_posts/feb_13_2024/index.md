# What I'm Doing Right now

This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about) inspired by the amazing [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). If you ever need inspiration check him out!

Updated: February 13th, 2024. Hoping to update this every month and list past versions at the bottom.

### Readings:

- Currently reading [Web Scalability for Startup Engineers](https://www.amazon.com/Scalability-Startup-Engineers-Artur-Ejsmont/dp/0071843655). The book is a bit older, which has been easy to notice as the lack of comment on modern frameworks. However that may be a positive as its helped to better see the recent history of software systems. Its been easily readable and has been a perfect primer.

I was initially planning to read Designing Distributed Systems after having purchased it a few months ago. However I made a mistake and closed the amazon account for which I had purchased the eBook... Note to self, if you have two accounts and are trying to consolidate them, double check what will be lost.

- Also re-read the short story [A Pail of Air](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51461/51461-h/51461-h.htm) by Fritz Leiber and it was just as amazing as when I last read it.

### Travel:

- Got to visit some friends for the super bowl in Columbus OH. Great city as always, shame the Lions were't playing though :(

Now currently trying to find the polaroid from the weekend...

### Study:

- Currently studying Calculus for future plans of pursuing a masters in CS, and working on React Native projects. Its been fun! (Well, React Native has been. Can't say the same for calculus)

### Interviewing:

Currently interviewing with half a dozen copmanies over the past few weeks. Its been okay. It stressed me out at first but the stress went away as I started enjoying studying again.

### Running:

Fell off of running over the past few weeks after having previously been consistent with 40+ miles a week. Hard to get back to it when its so cold out but that seems to be turning around and I'm looking forward to fall
