# Hi, I'm Sean Flanagan!

Optimist who likes software, chess, Michigan sports ã€½ (Go blue!), distance running, skiing, and travel (resulting in a sabbatical and traveling [East Asia](/blog/solo-travel-asia))!

Besides travel I'm an energetic software developer with proficiency for research and diving deep into technical challenges. I love exploring new, innovative technologies and applying them whenever deemed valuable.

Prior to diving into software I ran my own company, Laptologist LLC. Through research, social media marketing, and affiliate marketing I directly drove over $5 million in sales. Unfortunately I grew disinterested in the sales and marketing world.

### Employment Highlights:

- Currently at Trajector, where I hope to build valuable highlights!

- At Livegistics there are two projects I'm most proud of.
  - First, the completion of a feature allowing large scale data imports from client FTP servers. The hundreds-of-thousands of rows from various files had to be able to be imported, massaged, and inserted into a postgres database.
  - Second, a complete overhaul of the react native app used by construction companies in production. I had to take ownership of the project, assist in planning, and build out hundreds of features.
