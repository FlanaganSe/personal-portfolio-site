# Hi, I'm Sean Flanagan!

Optimist who likes software, chess, Michigan sports ã€½ (Go blue!), distance running, skiing, and travel (so much so that I went on a recent sabbatical and traveled [East Asia](/blog/solo-travel-asia))!

Besides travel I'm an energetic full stack Javascript developer with proficiency for research and diving deep into technical challenges. I love exploring new, innovative technologies and applying them whenever possible. I also have a deep appreciation for smooth internal practices and am a proponent for simplifying processes and minimizing controllable complexity.

Prior to diving deep into software I ran my own company, Laptologist LLC. Through deep research and leveraging social media channels I directly drove over $5 million in sales. Unfortunately I grew disinterested in the marketing world but it timed perfectly with a rise of interest in the technicalities of software engineering. Above all the experience led me to gain a deeper aptitude and appreciation for the challenges of entrepreneurship.

I'd love to chat about what I can bring to the table so [contact me](mailto:flanagansean19@gmail.com)!
