### Readings:

- Currently reading [Web Scalability for Startup Engineers](https://www.amazon.com/Scalability-Startup-Engineers-Artur-Ejsmont/dp/0071843655). Wrote about this in the last now!

- Slowly working through [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/1680502441). Probably going to take a while but its been good!

### Travel:

- Hoping to travel to Cleveland next month for the [Apr 8 2024 Solar Eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/) assuming the weather isn't looking dreadful!

### Flying:

- Registered an appointment to get [First Class Medical](https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/standards) in hopes of taking an introductory flying class this summer :)

### Running:

[Strava Link](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67717273), although can't promise I'll get back into a routine of uploading...

- Shoutout Punxsutawney Phil for predicting an early spring as the weather has really turned around. Getting outside has been beautiful and hopefully getting back on the routine!
- Was initially going to run the Capital City half marathon in columbus but I think friends and I are diverting plans to attend the [2024 NFL Draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_NFL_draft) in Detroit that weekend
