## Healthy Habits

Health is a highly contentnious topic that is full of misinformation. A major issue seems to be that people are especially susceptible to the placebo effect when it comes to health products. It can be easy to become convinced that XYZ pill was a miracle that greatly improved one or more aspects of ones' life when the entire effect was likely the placebo effect. As a result it's difficult to comb through and find advice that is going to be valuable for most others.

This was a pragmatic and resaerch-based attempt to identify habits that are significantly likely to be healthy. ~50 hours of research in mid-2020 was put into creating this document.

## Daily Life Habits

- Manipulate your environment to make healthy habits more convenient (e.g. Make it more convenient to get water over soda)
- Chronic stress is exceptionally damaging. Constantly recognize and minimize causes of stress. Mindfulness meditation, regular breaks from work / study, and introspection / journaling may relieve stress in some people.
- Daily exercise is exceptionally important and has been shown to improve sleep, cognition, wellbeing, and more.
- Maximize time on enjoyable passions / hobbies. Especially those that may bring long-term rewards such as hiking, socializing, video games.
- Engage in frequent positive self-talk. The simple act of believing in yourself and being confident in your abilities can signficantly improve wellbeing, exercise capabilities, and performance on exams

## Nutrition and Dieting

Dieting is exceptionally controversial. While there are a lot of conflicting opinions, some of the most universal include:

- Eat more veggies; cut-down on processed foods, added sugar, alcohol and animal fat
- Home-cook more, use a variety of seasonings, drink water / tea / coffee
- Maintaining low body fat may improve longterm health. Best accomplished by marginal calorie restriction
- Attempting to restrict calories by adopting a fad diet or temporary diet (over a few months) can be detrimental for ones health. Rather than attempting a short-term diet, it is significantly better to work on improving ones' long-term diet.
- Intermittant fasting is only worth considering if planning to maintain the eating pattern for years / decades. Its only value comes from the calorie restriction often accompanied with the diet.

## Sleep

- The vast majority of people would benefit from reaching 7 - 8 hours of sleep per night
- Sleep preferably without an alarm clock -- if using an alarm clock, refrain from snoozing
- Power naps 7 - 8 hours after waking up may be beneficial but may be a sign of lack of night-time sleep
- Sleep at same time every day, have a 30+ min pre-sleep routine, sleep in a cold room
- Caffien has a half-life of approximately 5 hours. Avoid excess intake within ~10 hours of sleep
- Avoid stimulating activities before sleep (drugs, alcohol, blue light, snacking, exercise, social media, etc)

## Supplements

While there are hundreds of supplements proclaiming astounding benefits the vast majority have little-to-no quality research backing them. The only legal supplements with substantial evidence I found include:

- Exercise: Whey Protein Powder, Creatine, Beta Alanine, Caffeine
- Vitamins: Vitamin D, Magnesium, Fish Oil (only beneficial if diet is deficient)
- Sleep: Melatonin (0.1 - 0.5 mg taken ~30 minutes before sleep)
